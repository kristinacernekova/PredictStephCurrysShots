# PredictStephCurrysShots
In this project, we build a model that will predict whether Steph Curry will make his next shot using 10 years of historical data.

This project contains 10 parts:
- Importing data.
- Feature engineering.
- Splitting data into a feature matrix and target vector.
- Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Establishing baseline accuracy.
- Building a model with a transformer and a tree-based predictor.
- Calculating training and validation accuracy.
- Tuning model hyperparameters.
- Calculating precision and recall from a confusion matrix.
- Plotting a confusion matrix.
